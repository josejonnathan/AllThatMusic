The band is celebrated for its dynamic stage presence, thought-provoking lyrics, and ability to evolve while staying true to its punk roots. Green Day remains a significant force in the punk rock scene and continues to inspire new generations of musicians and fans.", "youtube_link": "https://www.youtube.com/user/greenday", "deezer_link": "https://www.deezer.com/artist/52", "instagram_link": "https://www.instagram.com/greenday"}}, {"model": "frontend.artist", "pk": 3, "fields": {"name": "Oasis", "photo_url": "https://e-cdns-images.dzcdn.net/images/artist/bafbda4f8507af52be228cfe08d3b460/500x500-000000-80-0-0.jpg", "photo": "", "review": "", "youtube_link": null, "deezer_link": "https://www.deezer.com/artist/927", "instagram_link": null}}, {"model": "frontend.artist", "pk": 4, "fields": {"name": "Blur", "photo_url": "https://e-cdns-images.dzcdn.net/images/artist/e1fe5cc77138cba2bff3a26efeb8f5c6/500x500-000000-80-0-0.jpg", "photo": "", "review": "", "youtube_link": null, "deezer_link": "https://www.deezer.com/artist/743", "instagram_link": null}}, {"model": "frontend.artist", "pk": 5, "fields": {"name": "Creed", "photo_url": "https://e-cdns-images.dzcdn.net/images/artist/a1be660bf8d352a97e45e9c9e5214629/500x500-000000-80-0-0.jpg", "photo": "", "review": "Creed was a popular American rock band known for their distinctive post-grunge sound and emotive lyrics.

The band enjoyed critical and commercial success, winning several awards and achieving multi-platinum status. Despite their success, Creed experienced internal conflicts, leading to their disbandment in the early 2000s.\r\n\r\nCreed's legacy endures due to their powerful performances, memorable songs, and the emotional connection they established with fans.

come to a party?\nMy friends picked me up in their truck at 11:30\nThis thing's at a frat house, but people are cool there\nReluctant I followed, but I never dreamed there\nWould be someone there who would catch my attention\nI wasn't out searching for love or affection\nSo I payed my three and the girls got in free\nShine the beer for tequila and we headed into the party\n\nAnd then in the backyard some terrible ska band\nSomeone in the background was doing a keg stand\n\nThis place is so lame, all these girls look the same\nAll these guys have no game, I wish I would have stayed\nIn my bed back at home watching TV alone\nWhere I'd put on some porn or have sex on the phone\nFar from people I hate, down from Anywhere State\nTrying to intoxicate girls to give them head after the party\n\nAnd then I saw her standing there\nWith green eyes and long blond hair\nShe wasn't wearing underwear at least I prayed that\nShe might be the one, maybe we'd have some fun\nMaybe we'd watch the sunrise\nBut that night I learned some girls try too hard\n\n\nDa na na, da na na, da na na\nSome girls try too hard\nDa na na, da na na, da na na\nAnd some girls try too hard to impress\nWith the way that they dress\nWith those things on their chests\nAnd the things they suggest to me\n\nI couldn't believe what this lady was saying\nThe names she was dropping, the games she was playing\nShe dated this guy who now rides for Black Flys\nHow she's down with the wise well-constructed disguise\nNow I'd rather go dateless than stay here and hate this\nHer volume of makeup, her fake tits were tasteless\n\nSo I said I'd call her, but never would bother\nUntil I got turned down by another girl at a party\n\nSo when you see her standing there\nWith green eyes and long blonde hair\nShe won't be wearing underwear and you'll discover\nThis girl's not the one and she'll never be fun\nYou should just turn and run\nBecause you'll find out that some girls try too hard\n\nDa na na, da na na, da na na\nSome girls try too hard\nDa na na, da na na, da na na\nAnd some girls try too hard to impress\nWith the way that they dress\n\nWith those things on their chests\nAnd the things they suggest to

tied\nThe billions shift from side to side\nAnd the wars go on with brainwashed pride\nFor the love of God and our human rights\nAnd all these things are swept aside\nBy bloody hands time can't deny\nAnd are washed away by your genocide\nAnd history hides the lies of our civil wars\n\n\n\nD'you wear a black armband\nWhen they shot the man\nWho said \"Peace could last forever\"\nAnd in my first memories\nThey shot Kennedy\nI went numb when I learned to see\nSo I never fell for Vietnam\nWe got the wall of D.C. to remind us all\nThat you can't trust freedom\nWhen it's not in your hands\nWhen everybody's fightin'\nFor their promised land\n\nAnd\nI don't need your civil war\nIt feeds the rich while it buries the poor\nYou're power hungry sellin' soldiers\nIn a human grocery store\n\nAin't that fresh\nI don't need your civil war\n\nLook at the shoes you're filling\nLook at the blood we're spilling\nLook at the world we're killing\nThe way we've always done before\nLook in the doubt we've wallowed\nLook at the leaders we've followed\nLook at the lies we've swallowed\nAnd I don't want to hear no more\n\nMy hands are tied\nFor all I've seen has changed my mind\nBut still the wars go on and the years go by\nWith no love of God or human rights\n'Cause all these dreams are swept aside\nBy bloody hands of the hypnotized\n\nWho carry the cross of homicide\nAnd history bears the scars of our civil wars\n\nWe practice selective annihilation\nOf mayors and government officials\nFor example to create a vacuum\nThen we fill that vacuum\nAs popular war advances\nPeace is closer\n\nI don't need your civil war\nIt feeds the rich while it buries the poor\nYou're power hungry sellin' soldiers\nIn a human grocery store\nAin't that fresh\nAnd I don't need your civil war\nI

fight\nFlashing for the refugees on the unarmed road of flight\nAn' for each an' ev'ry underdog soldier in the night\nAn' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.\n\nThrough the city's melted furnace, unexpectedly we watched\n\nWith faces hidden while the walls were tightening\nAs the echo of the wedding bells before the blowin' rain\nDissolved into the bells of the lightning\nTolling for

chased an' cheated by pursuit\nAn' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.\n\n\nEven though a cloud's white curtain in a far-off corner flashed\nAn' the hypnotic splattered mist was slowly lifting\nElectric light still struck like arrows, fired but for the ones\nCondemned to drift or else be kept from drifting\nTolling for the searching ones, on their speechless, seeking trail\nFor the lonesome-hearted lovers with too personal a tale\nAn' for each unharmful, gentle soul misplaced inside a jail\nAn' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.\n\nStarry-eyed an' laughing as I recall when we were caught\n\nTrapped by no track of hours for they hanged suspended\nAs we listened one last time an' we watched with one last look\nSpellbound an' swallowed 'til the tolling ended\nTolling for the aching ones whose wounds cannot be nursed\nFor the countless confused, accused, misused, strung-out ones an' worse\nAn' for every hung-up person in the whole wide universe\nAn' we gazed upon

has been stolen\nAnd the mailbox is locked.\nOh, Mama, can this really be the end,\nTo be stuck inside of Mobile\nWith the Memphis blues again.\n\nMona tried to tell me\nTo stay away from the train line.\nShe said that all the railroad men\nJust drink up your blood like wine.\nAn' I said, \"Oh, I didn't know that,\nBut then again, there's only one I've met\nAn' he just smoked my eyelids\nAn' punched my cigarette.\"\nOh, Mama, can this really be the end,\nTo be stuck inside of Mobile\n\nWith the Memphis blues again.\n\nGrandpa died last week\nAnd now he's buried in the rocks,\nBut everybody still talks about\nHow badly they were shocked.\nBut me, I expected it to happen,\nI knew he'd lost control\nWhen he built a fire on Main Street\nAnd shot it full of holes.\nOh, Mama, can this really be the end,\nTo be stuck inside of Mobile\nWith the Memphis blues again.\n\nNow the senator came down here\nShowing ev'ryone his gun,\nHanding out free tickets\nTo the wedding of his son.\n\nAn' me, I nearly got busted\nAn' wouldn't it be my luck\nTo get caught without a ticket\nAnd be discovered beneath a truck.\nAw, Mama, is this really the end,\nTo be stuck inside of Mobile\nWith the Memphis blues again.\n\nNow the teen preacher looked so baffled\nWhen I asked him why he dressed\nWith twenty pounds of headlights\nStapled to his chest.\nBut he cursed me when I proved to him,\nThen I whispered,said \"Not even you can hide.\nYou see, you're just like me,\nI hope you're satisfied.\"\nOh, Mama, can this really be the end,\nTo be stuck inside of Mobile\n\nWith the Memphis blues again.\n\nNow the rainman gave me two cures,\nThen he said, \"Jump right in.\"\nThe one was Texas medicine,\nThe other was just railroad gin.\nAn' like a fool I mixed them\nAn' it strangled up my mind,\nAn' now people just get uglier\nAn' I have no sense of time.\nOh, Mama, can this really be the end,\nTo be stuck inside of Mobile\nWith the Memphis blues again.\n\nWhen Ruthie says come see her\nIn her honky-tonk lagoon,\nWhere I can watch her waltz for free\n'Neath her Panamanian moon.\n\nAn' I say, \"Aw come on now,\nYou know you know about my debutante.\"\nAn' she says, \"Your debutante just knows what you need\nBut I know what you want.\"\nOh, Mama, can this really be the end,\nTo be stuck inside of Mobile\nWith the Memphis blues again.\n\nNow the bricks lay on Grand Street\nWhere the neon madmen climb.\nThey all fall there so perfectly,\nIt all seems so well timed.\nAn' here I sit so patiently\nWaiting to find out what price\nYou have to pay to get out of\nGoing through all these things twice.\nOh, Mama, is this really the end,\n\nTo be stuck here inside of Mobile\nWith the Memphis blues again.", "youtube_link": null, "deezer_link":
